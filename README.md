# Primitive Lite

This is a simplified version of https://github.com/fogleman/primitive
All credit goes to that author!

I needed two things that required this fork.
1. An npm repo so this could be a node dependency
2. Some minor tweaks to the svg triangle construction to make the svg's more responsive: https://github.com/fogleman/primitive/pull/79

If you need this repo updated, please ping me, I'll probably forget!
